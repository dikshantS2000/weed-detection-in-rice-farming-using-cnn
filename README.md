# weed-detection-in-rice-farming-using-cnn

This project focuses on automating weed detection in rice field images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It aims to support precision agriculture by identifying unwanted plants, enabling better crop yield and reduced herbicide use.

📌 Objective

Detect and classify weeds vs. non-weeds in rice field images using a deep learning model.

🧠 Model

Architecture: Custom CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Input: RGB images of rice fields.
Output: Binary classification (Weed / No Weed).
Techniques: Data augmentation, normalization, dropout for regularization.

📂 Dataset

Sourced from Kaggle or agricultural research datasets containing annotated images of weeds in rice fields.
Preprocessing included resizing images and balancing classes for training.
